# Current projects

At any given time there are quite a few projects floating around in the back of my head. Working unsociable hours 6 days a week means that I have relatively little time for personal projects (although I do like to combine them with work projects when I can), and so choosing what to do with limited spare time can be a challenge.

A typical day off starts with catching up on missed sleep, before proceeding to do those simple things in life like tidying, cooking, and generally making myself feel like a competent human being! Then, by mid afternoon I find myself drifting over to my desk with the desire to make progress on one of my "projects", but which one to work on?

There are so many to choose from and many different reasons to pick each. For example right now I have the following technical projects on the go:

- Writing posts for this website, with the goal of providing useful information about technical theatre for people like me
- A portfolio for my other website (samlane.tech)
- A lightweight sACN and Artnet implementation for embedded platforms (including RDM support) that I've temporarily dubbed sACNet
- An ESP32 based set lighting monitoring system (Project Coeus)
- Project Argus, my C++ based rig and show infrastructure monitoring and feedback program
- A replacement module for the Jem AF-1 MkII fan that provides RDM functionality
